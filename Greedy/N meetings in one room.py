""" There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (S[i], F[i]) where S[i] 
is start time of meeting i and F[i] is finish time of meeting i.

What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room?

Input:
The first line of input consists number of the test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
The first line consists of the size of the array, second line has the array containing the starting 
time of all the meetings each separated by a space, i.e., S [ i ]. And the third line has the array 
containing the finishing time of all the meetings each separated by a space, i.e., F [ i ].

Output:
In each separate line print the order in which the meetings take place separated by a space.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 70
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ S[ i ], F[ i ] ≤ 100000

Example:
Input:
